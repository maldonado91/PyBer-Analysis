# PyBer-Analysis

### 1. Overview of PyBer Analysis:
#### We previously summarized PyBer data for fares, drivers count and ride count for the various city types, which include, urban, suburban and rural areas. Now we are taking it a step further to expand usidng the date information availbale in our dataset. The ojective is to visualize total fares across all city types over time. We will group the dates into weekly buckets and plot using line charts.

### 2. PyBer Analysis Results:
Below is a table that summarizes down ride-share data for total rides, total drivers and total fares, along with average fare per driver and ride.

To visualize the above information, we added three pie carts:

We also wanted to add a bit of time series plots to help see total fares by week over the course of the first few months of the year.

 ### 3 Summary:
#### 
 1. The forth week of Feburary has a jump in fares across all city types. We can establish a driver incentive to continue this trend in every city type for this week. 
 
 2. Sububurban areas make up ~30% of all fares but only have ~16% of the total drivers. It's possible the fares in suburban areas can be higher but there lacks drivers. We can make a push to increase the driver count in suburban cities. 
 
 3. Urban areas drive the business and currently there is no shortage of drivers, however, the average fare/ride is ~$24 and could discourage riders from using the service. Lowering the fares slightly might help incease the amount of rides in Urban areas.
